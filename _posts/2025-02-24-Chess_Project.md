## Overview

This is a game I am using to teach me the basics of kotlin. I have
never created anything in Kotlin, but in high school, I learned Java
for two years. The aim is to learn classes, basic logic, and
control flow, and apply some knowledge I have learned in my classes
in University.

## Gameplay

Currently, I am still working on the project, but I want it to be possible
to win, lose, and draw in the game. I will aim to have all chess rules,
including ones that few have ever heard of such as en' passente. In the
future I am interested in implementing a UI and an AI so I can learn more
about the language.
