This is the project I made for an animation class. Before creating this
I had very little experience using Pygame, and had mostly used Python for
competitive programming.

## Controls

The player can use the mouse to start and quit the game. At the moment, the
`a` and `d` keys are the only controls the player has access to, controlling
left and right respectively.

## Gameplay

Initially I was going to have little weevils for the player to fight, but I ran
out of time. At the moment the game ends when the player reaches the x coord of
5000.

The background moves using Parallax, I animated the player's movement and did
all the art using Aseprite.

## Images

Place holder for now, still learning how to use this website magic.

## Wishlist

In the future, I'd like to turn it into an actual game, some of the things I'd
like to have in it include:

- Weevils, or some similar forest enemy.
- NPC's, some for weapons, armour, items, charms and dialogue (for the story).
- Player health
- A damage indicator - player is green when health and gradually turns brown
while the player takes more and more damage.
- Other controls: Jump, Dash, Glide, Wall Jump, Fight, Use Item.
- Have a place to save player progess.
- A story.
